Please read the doc:  
"<a href="docs/Quasimodo_jig_revA.pdf">Simple, No-Math Transformer Snubber using “Quasimodo” Test Jig</a>" by Mark Johnson  
this is what this repo is all about

here is also a mathematical approach from TI   
(but for switched-mode power supplies. However, it can also be used for 50/60 Hz applications)
